For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

### made a website off norapi
the site only contains the anime i specified in norapi repo, check https://github.com/noornee/norapi/blob/main/sauce.json

### already deployed it on heroku, here's the sauce : 
https://noranime.herokuapp.com/

i added a localstorage checkbox feature to it because most times anytime i want to download anime from a site, i'm always forgetting the episode i watched last.
here's how it works, once you've downloaded the anime of ur choice, check the checkbox of the anime you've downloaded and tap the save button. the next time u wanna download an anime from the site, the checked checkbox would be how u left it...cool huh?ðŸ˜„
### here's a preview:
